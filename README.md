# Interview-Exercise


This exercise was created with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


I have created a component called [PhonesCard] in which I describe what parameters in the [phones.json] file I want to render.

I have created a component called [PhonesList] in which the data is extracted from the file [phones.json] and a map is made to scan the file and extract the requested data.

I have created a component called [PhoneDetails] in which the details of each selected Phone are painted. (This component could not finish it in the stipulated time)

[App.js] has been entered into the Router in [index.js].

In [App.js] the components are called and component paths are created. (Also unfinished)

Installed packages (react-router-dom) (bootstrap)
